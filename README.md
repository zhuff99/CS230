Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?



We are to create a game like the television show Win, Lose, or Draw. Where our application will render an image over the span of 30 seconds. During this time team 1 will be able to guess what the image is if they get it wrong or run out of time team 2 will have 15 seconds to steal their points. Each team can have multiple players, game and team names must be unique, and only one instance of a game can exists in memory at any given time.

I researched the project heavily and learned a lot of valuable information in doing so. I think I did well in my write up explaining the evaluation and design constraints. I struggled with the evaluation for mobile devices and the server-side. This is because I have the least knowledge in these topics and this would be the section I would revise, along with the recommendations. I based my entire project around the user's needs, because at the end of the day they will be the ones playing the game. Research is one of the most important parts when it comes to designing software. If you have a well documented and researched software design template it will be much easier to begin work on coding the project itself.
